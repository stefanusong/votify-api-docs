#### Endpoint

#### Requests
The Votify API sticks to RESTful principles. Standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint are used to retrieve data resources. 
Web API employs the proper HTTP verbs for each action, whenever possible:

| METHOD   | ACTION |
| :------  | :----- |
| GET      | Retrieves resources |
| POST     | Creates resources |
| PUT      | Changes and/or replaces resources or collections |
| DELETE   | Deletes resources |


#### Responses
All responses in this API is a JSON object that conforms to the following standard base response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Vote has been created",
    "data": null,
    "error": null
}
```
`success` is a boolean type that indicates whether the request was successful or unsuccessful\
`message` is a string type that contains a general message for the response\
`data` is any type that contains the data that will be returned\
`error` is any type that contains the detailed error message\
