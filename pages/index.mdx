# Introduction

Thank you for visiting Votify! Votify is an API boilerplate written in the Go Programming Language that allows you to easily build your own voting app.
The Votify API allows you to make your own vote, participate in an ongoing vote, and view the voting results.
This API also includes a basic authentication and authorization mechanism that makes use of JWT tokens.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

These are the tools that you will need to run the API locally:

- Go Programming Language
- Docker
- WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux) For Windows User

### Project Setup

**1. Clone the API source code**

import GithubBtn from "../components/GithubBtn";

<GithubBtn />

Note: (For windows users, clone the project in WSL environment)

**2. Create .env file**
- Go inside the project directory
- Create new .env file
- Copy the default values from the .env.example file
- You can modify the values or just leave as it is

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  The values inside the .env file will also be automatically used for the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
  
</Callout>

**3. Run the API**

- Open your terminal and go inside the project directory
- Run `docker compose up{:zsh}` or `make run{:zsh}` if you have Makefile configured in your machine
- The previous command will automatically creates 3 running container:
  - API server (on localhost:8080)
  - Postgres database server (on localhost:5432)
  - PgAdmin dashboard (on localhost:5050)

**4. Finished**
Now, you can start using or modifying the API.
